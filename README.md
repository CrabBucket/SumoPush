# SumoPush

SumoPush is intended to be a networked game with two players.  The essential id is a 2d side view fighting game,
where your goal is to push the other player out of the play area or dodge the other player as they try to do so
and watch them send themselves to oblivion.  I plan to do all the networking by hand using rust standard library
but the graphics and input will be handled by some external library like piston.
